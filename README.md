# DMBake

An Android application created from scratch designed to display recipes from [this json](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/May/59121517_baking/baking.json/) within 
different fragments to show a different UI depending on device/screen size. 

This app also displays a widget showing information from the last viewed recipe to the user on the home screen.

## Getting Started

If you want to see the application in action, clone the project and unzip it to your desired folder location. Open the project in Android Studio and build. 

Note: Android Studio may ask you to update certain dependencies. This is not reccomended as the project hasn't been tested using other configurations. Ignore these updates and run in an emulator with an Android APK level declared in the app folder's build.gradle file.

### Built With

* [ExoPlayer](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer) - An application level media player for Android
